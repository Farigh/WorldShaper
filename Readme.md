# WorldShaper

This was a little Java game project I started in 2013.
It was a time I loved playing Terraria and spent a significant amount of time in transport.
I decided to create a similar game on Android so I can keep playing during this time.

Not long after I started this project, the Terraria Android portage came out and I dropped this project.
Here is the source code if you're interested. The game might need some adjustment to run on modern Android devices though.
